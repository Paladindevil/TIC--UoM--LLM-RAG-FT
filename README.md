# TIC -- UoM LLM RAG and FT

Welcome to the LLM RAG and FT repository. Please refer to this repo if you need to either RAG/Finetune an LLM.

In this repository, you can find two projects referred to as [GemmaRAG](https://github.com/Turing-Innovation-Catalyst-Collab/TIC--UoM--LLM-RAG-FT/tree/initialCommit/GemmaRAG) and [GemmaFineTune](https://github.com/Turing-Innovation-Catalyst-Collab/TIC--UoM--LLM-RAG-FT/tree/initialCommit/GemmaFineTune). Each of these projects contains its own README.md to provide further clarifiation.

As their names suggest, the GemmaRAG folder contains an AI Assistant trained on Wikipedia articles using the RAG method. However, the code is not optimized to be user-friendly. On the other hand, GemmaFineTune contains user-friendly code that fine-tunes Gemma (which can be modified to be any AI as long as it exists on Hugging Face) to perform the specific task of guessing a prompt from two input strings.
